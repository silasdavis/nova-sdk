**Nova** is a new Maker actor whose goal is to distribute [Maker DSR rate](https://makerburn.com/#/dsr) to untapped markets.

We do this by ensuring deep sDAI liquidity on several networks, and by helping technical integration via SDKs to enable a quick and flexible integration to clients' systems.

We currently support `Python` and plan to support `Go` and `Typescript` in a near future. Please find technical documentation of each SDK in the left bar.
